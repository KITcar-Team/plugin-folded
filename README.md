# plugin-folded
Foldable page sections for DokuWiki

Since there is a collision with the original syntax and "C++" we have a new syntax:

This is example +#THIS TEXT IS KLICKABLE | This text is foldable. But Text only+#. And C++ is not affected

++++ KLICKABLE TEXT |

EVERYTHING here is hidden until unfolded.
Tables, pictures, Calendars etc.

++++
